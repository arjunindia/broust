																	 The 
																	<b>
																		transgender rights movement
																	 is a movement to promote the 
																	<a>
																		legal status of transgender people
																	 and to eliminate 
																	<a>
																		discrimination
																	 and 
																	<a>
																		violence
																	 against 
																	<a>
																		transgender
																	 people regarding housing, employment, public accommodations, education, and health care. A major goal of transgender activism is to allow changes to identification documents to conform with a person's current 
																	<a>
																		gender identity
																	 without the need for 
																	<a>
																		gender-affirming surgery
																	 or any medical requirements, which is known as 
																	<i>
																		<a>
																			gender self-identification
																	.

																		History
																<p>
																	Identifying the boundaries of a trans movement has been a matter of some debate. Conventionally, evidence of a codified political identity emerges in 1952, when 
																	<a>
																		Virginia Prince
																	, a 
																	<a>
																		trans woman
																	, along with others, launched 
																	<i>
																		<a>
																			Transvestia: The Journal of the American Society for Equality in Dress
																	. This publication is considered by some to be the beginning of the transgender rights movement in the United States, however it would be many years before the term "transgender", itself, would come into common usages.
																	<sup>
																		<a>
																			&#91;4&#93;
																<p>
																	In the years before the 
																	<a>
																		Stonewall riots
																	, 
																	<a>
																		other actions for LGBT rights had taken place
																	.

																<p>
																	An early, but not widely known, action is the 
																	<a>
																		Cooper Do-nuts Riot
																	 of 1959 that took place in Downtown Los Angeles,
																	<sup>
																		<a>
																			&#91;5&#93;
																	 when drag queens, lesbians, gay men, and transgender people who hung out at Cooper Do-nuts and who were frequently harassed by the 
																	<a>
																		LAPD
																	 fought back after police arrested three people, including 
																	<a>
																		John Rechy
																	. Patrons began pelting the police with donuts and coffee cups. The LAPD called for backup and arrested several rioters. Rechy and the other two original detainees were able to escape.
																	<sup>
																		<a>
																			&#91;6&#93;
																<p>
																	In August 1966 the 
																	<a>
																		Compton's Cafeteria riot
																	 occurred in the 
																	<a>
																		Tenderloin
																	 district of 
																	<a>
																		San Francisco
																	. This incident was one of the first recorded 
																	<a>
																		LGBT
																	-related riots in United States history.
																	<sup>
																		<a>
																			&#91;6&#93;
																	 In an incident similar to Cooper's, drag queens, prostitutes, and trans people fought back against police harassment. When a transgender woman resisted arrest by throwing coffee at a police officer, drag queens poured into the streets, fighting back with their high heels and heavy bags.
																	<sup>
																		<a>
																			&#91;7&#93;
																	 The next night, the regular patrons were joined by 
																	<a>
																		street hustlers
																	, Tenderloin street people, and other members of the LGBT community in their stand against police violence.
																	<sup>
																		<a>
																			&#91;8&#93;
																	 It marked the beginning of trans activism in San Francisco.
																	<sup>
																		<a>
																			&#91;9&#93;
																<p>
																	In 1969, the year of the 
																	<a>
																		Stonewall riots
																	, the term transgender was not yet in use. But 
																	<a>
																		gender nonconforming
																	 people like drag king 
																	<a>
																		Stormé DeLarverie
																	, and self-identified "street queen" 
																	<a>
																		Marsha P. Johnson
																	 were in the vanguard of the riots, with DeLarverie widely believed to be the person whose struggle with the police was the spark that set the crowd to fight back.
																	<sup>
																		<a>
																			&#91;10&#93;
																	<sup>
																		<a>
																			&#91;11&#93;
																	 Witnesses to the uprising also place early trans activists and members of the 
																	<a>
																		Gay Liberation Front
																	, Zazu Nova and Jackie Hormona along with Johnson, as combatants "in the vanguard" of the pushback against the police on the multiple nights of the rebellion.
																	<sup>
																		<a>
																			&#91;12&#93;
																<p>
																	Marsha P. Johnson later went on to co-found 
																	<a>
																		Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries
																	 (STAR) with a close friend, 
																	<a>
																		Sylvia Rivera
																	. Rivera's early definitions around trans were very broad, including all gender-nonconforming people.
																	<sup>
																		<a>
																			&#91;13&#93;
																	
Rivera continued to be an advocate for trans rights, and inclusion of protection for trans people in all LGBT rights legislation, until her death in 2002.
																	<sup>
																		<a>
																			&#91;14&#93;
																<p>
																	In the 1980s female to male (
																	<a>
																		FTM
																	) transsexuality became more broadly known.
																	<sup>
																		<a>
																			&#91;15&#93;
																<p>
																	In 1992 
																	<a>
																		Leslie Feinberg
																	 printed and circulated a pamphlet titled "Transgender Liberation: A Movement Whose Time Has Come". Feinberg's pamphlet begins by calling on the trans community to compose their definitions, invoking language as a tool that unites people divided by oppression. From here, Feinberg traces the emergence of oppression imposed by the ruling class using institutions. These institutions, run by the elite, enforce a gender binary at the expense of communal societies that encouraged liberal gender expression. Women were devalued and effeminacy was disparaged to promote patriarchal economic privilege. According to Feinberg, the 
																	<a>
																		gender binary
																	 is a contrivance of Western civilization. Having acknowledged this, Feinberg encourages all humans to reclaim the natural continuum of 
																	<a>
																		gender expression
																	 that identifies trans individuals as sacred. Feinberg concludes by empowering the 
																	<a>
																		working class
																	 to liberate themselves from the 
																	<a>
																		ruling class
																	, which can be achieved by directing the 
																	<a>
																		labor
																	 of 
																	<a>
																		marginalized groups
																	 towards the common goal of revolution.
																	<sup>
																		<a>
																			&#91;16&#93;
																<p>
																	During the early 1990s, 
																	<a>
																		travesti
																	 activism took off in Argentina, which established itself within the broader national LGBT movement as among the groups with the longest trajectory and impact.
																	<sup>
																		<a>
																			&#91;17&#93;
																	<sup>
																		<a>
																			&#91;18&#93;
																<p>
																	In 1993, 
																	<a>
																		Adela Vázquez
																	, a Latina transgender woman, protested in 
																	<a>
																		San Francisco
																	 over the government removing the transgender community from the workforce because they labeled them disabled.
																	<sup>
																		<a>
																			&#91;19&#93;
																	 However, that situation is making some progress and is changing. In 2014, per The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force record, only 17 states (and the District of Columbia) in the United States of America have laws that protect individuals in the transgender community, which equals to about 45%. States that present these protections are: 
																	<a>
																		California
																	, 
																	<a>
																		Colorado
																	, 
																	<a>
																		Connecticut
																	, 
																	<a>
																		Delaware
																	, 
																	<a>
																		District of Columbia
																	, 
																	<a>
																		Hawaii
																	,

																		Vermont
																	, 
																	<a>
																		Washington
																	, and 
																	<a>
																		Wisconsin
																	.
																	<sup>
																		<a>
																			&#91;20&#93;
																	 Furthermore, there are organizations that are working to increase the numbers of States having these laws like: The Transgender, Gender Variant and Intersex Justice Project; The Transgender Law Center; and the National Center for Transgender Equality.

																	On December 31, 1993, a 
																	<a>
																		trans man
																	 named 
																	<a>
																		Brandon Teena
																	 was murdered in 
																	<a>
																		Nebraska
																	 along with two of his friends. This murder was documented in the 1999 movie 
																	<i>
																		<a>
																			Boys Don't Cry
																	 starring 
																	<a>
																		Hilary Swank
																	 as Brandon Teena.
																	<sup>
																		<a>
																			&#91;15&#93;
																<p>
																	With the publication of 1996's 
																	<i>
																		Transgender Warriors
																	, 
																	<a>
																		Leslie Feinberg
																	 brought the word "transgender" more fully into use. Like Rivera, Feinberg also defined "transgender" very broadly, including drag queens and gender-nonconforming people from history. A dedicated communist, Feinberg included an analysis of many who are oppressed by the apparatus of capitalism.
																	<sup>
																		<a>
																			&#91;21&#93;
																<p>
																	<a>
																		Transgender Day of Remembrance
																	, an annual day of remembrance to commemorate those murdered in transphobic hate crimes founded by transgender advocate, Gwendolyn Ann Smith, was first held in 1999 following the murder of 
																	<a>
																		Rita Hester
																	 in 1998.
																	<sup>
																		<a>
																			&#91;22&#93;
																	<sup>
																		<a>
																			&#91;23&#93;
																	 The "Remembering our Dead" web project was also set up in 1999.

																	In June 2012 
																	<a>
																		CeCe McDonald
																	 was wrongfully imprisoned for having defended herself against Neo-Nazi attackers with a pair of scissors, which resulted in the death of one of her assailants. Her story was publicized by a 
																	<a>
																		GLAAD Media Award
																	 winning article in 
																	<a>
																		Ebony.com
																	. 
																	<a>
																		Laverne Cox
																	, openly trans actress on 
																	<i>
																		<a>
																			Orange Is the New Black
																	, launched a campaign to raise the consciousness of cruel prison conditions for incarcerated trans individuals and rallied to free CeCe. After serving 19 months, she was released in January 2014.

																	 On March 26–27, 2013, LGBT activists gathered at the Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., to support marriage equality, but amid these demonstrations, one speaker was asked to edit their proceedings to conceal their trans identity, and the trans community was asked to lower their pride flags. This incident follows years of tension between activist groups, namely 
																	<a>
																		Human Rights Campaign
																	 and the trans community because the trans community is often neglected or blatantly excluded from events and political consideration. The incident resulted in a backlash and public criticism by the trans community. In response, activist groups apologized for the incident, and in 2014 HRC promised to energize efforts for promoting trans rights.

																	In Florida in March 2015, Representative Frank Artiles (R-Miami) proposed House Bill 583, which would ensure that individuals who enter public facilities such as bathrooms or locker rooms designated for those who are of the "other biological sex" could be jailed for up to 60 days. Artiles claims that it was proposed for the sake of public safety.

																	In September 2017, the Botswana High Court ruled that the refusal of the Registrar of National Registration to change a transgender man's gender marker was "unreasonable and violated his constitutional rights to dignity, privacy, freedom of expression, equal protection of the law, freedom from discrimination and freedom from inhumane and degrading treatment". LGBT activists celebrated the ruling, describing it as a great victory.
																	<sup>
																		<a>
																			&#91;26&#93;
																	<sup>
																		<a>
																			&#91;27&#93;
																	 At first, the Botswana Government announced it would appeal the ruling, but decided against it in December, supplying the trans man with a new identity document that reflects his gender identity.
																	<sup>
																		<a>
																			&#91;28&#93;
																<p>
																	A similar case, where a transgender woman sought to change her gender marker to female, was heard in December 2017. The High Court ruled that the Government must recognize her gender identity. She dedicated her victory to "every single trans diverse person in Botswana".

																		<a>
																			&#91;32&#93;

																	In the wake of the Mathis case, numerous states have put forth or passed legislation which obligates transgender people to use the public bathroom corresponding to their

																	.
																	<sup>
																		<a>
																			&#91;33&#93;
																	 As of July 2017, sixteen states had considered such bills and one state,

																	<a>
																		HB2
																	, was passed into law in February 2017.

																	The treatment of transgender people in educational environments has often been a focal point of the movement's concern. In a survey of Canadian high schools conducted between 2007 and 2009, 74% of students who identified themselves as transgender reported having experienced verbal harassment over their gender expression, 37% reported physical harassment over their gender expression, and 49% of trans students reported at least one instance of sexual harassment within the last school year.

																	<sup>
																		<a>
																			&#91;36&#93;
																	 Following the incident, the college's administration and student activists engaged in a protracted battle around transgender women's rights. The first women's college in the United States to open admission to transgender women was

																	<sup>
																		<a>
																			&#91;39&#93;
																	 Student activists at US women's colleges are credited for the introduction of more inclusionary policies allowing admission of trans women in spaces which historically have excluded them. Mount Holyoke remains gender-inclusive, admitting not only transgender women but also transgender men and non-binary people under its all-persons-but-cisgender-men policy.

																		Transgender people of color
																	 often face an identity that is under speculation, suspicion, doubt, and policing. Those within the trans community are often left out from the wealthy, able-bodied, American, and white experience that those in the non-trans community often focus on, and are subject to discrimination as a transgender person and as a person of color.
																	<sup>

																	 The focus of the realms of trans visibility in pop culture and trans organizations has mostly been on white people.
																	<sup>
																		<a>
																			&#91;47&#93;
																<p>
																	Historically, this is in part due to the rejection of an individual by family members at a young age. "The majority of transgender women of color", say Juline A. Koken, David S. Bimbi, and Jeffrey T. Parsons, "experience verbal and physical abuse at the hands of their family members upon disclosing their transgender identity."
																	<sup>
																		<a>
																			&#91;48&#93;
																<p>
																	As transgender women of color face both gender and racial discrimination, their experiences may be qualitatively different from white transgender women. African-American and Latino families are deeply rooted in religious tradition, which may lead to more socially conservative and rigid ideas about gender roles, homosexuality, and traditionalism. In addition, parents also worry that their children will face additional hardships as members of double minorities.

																	 According to a National Transgender Discrimination survey, the combination of anti-transgender bias and individual racism results in transgender people of color being 6 times more likely to experience physical violence when interacting with the police compared to cisgender White people, two-thirds of LGBT homicide victims being transgender women of color, and a startling 78% attempt suicide.

																	 Of the 17 homicides of trans and gender-nonconforming people in 2017 that the project has counted so far, 16 had been people of color; 15 had been transgender women; and 13 had been black transgender women.
																	<sup>
																		<a>
																			&#91;51&#93;
																	 The 
																	<a>
																		NCAVP
																	 survey also found that trans survivors were 1.7 times more likely to be the victims of sexual violence than cisgender survivors. Transgender/non-conforming individuals also reported over four times the national average of HIV infection (2.64% compared to 0.6%, respectively) with rates for transgender women (3.76%) and those who are unemployed (4.67%) being even higher.
																	<sup>
																		<a>
																			&#91;52&#93;
																	 Black transgender people were affected by HIV even more so than these averages; 20.23% of transgender individuals with HIV are black.
																	<sup>
																		<a>
																			&#91;53&#93;
																	 According to the National Transgender Discrimination Survey, 41% of respondents reported attempting suicide compared to 1.6% of the general population with unemployment, low income, and assault (both sexual and physical) raising the risk factors.

																	The social stigma of being transgender is a cause for poor health care, which manifests into other areas of transgender people. Social determinants of health, including violence and discrimination, may result in negative personal psychological and physiological effects.

																	 The access to proper health care is essential in both the transitioning and resilience. In a study of resilience of transgender people of color, Jay, a 41-year-old FTM POC, stated he "had no place to turn to get help in transition—and worked five jobs trying to save money for surgery that [he] never knew if [he] would be able to afford."
																	<sup>
																		<a>
																			&#91;54&#93;
																	 Another key factor to the resilience to opposition of transgender POC involved having a strong sense of pride in both ethnic and gender identities. Developing this sense of pride can be a process, which involves overcoming barriers such as transphobia and racism. However, once these barriers are in fact crossed, transgender POC can start to see themselves in a better light and use their inner strength and confidence to be more persistent, optimistic, and positivity-oriented.

																<p>
																	In recent years, there have been several housing crises among transgender people, especially transgender people of color. According to a 2016 Gallup poll, 10.052 million people in the United States identify as lesbian, gay, or transgender, and millennials, or those born between 1980 and 1998, drive virtually all of all of the increases overall LGBT self-identification.
																	<sup>
																		<a>
																			&#91;55&#93;
																	 As the millennial generation has entered the college age, trans individuals have seen difficulty in securing basic housing rights and needs. There is a definite predominance of sex-segregated bathrooms, locker rooms, and housing where transgender people regularly are denied access, and are harassed and challenged for their gender identity.
																	<sup>
																		<a>
																			&#91;56&#93;
																	 Most universities operate on the premise that gender is binary and static, and this can be especially problematic with either poorer transgender individuals or transgender people of color, since 55% of college students in the United States are white
																	<sup>
																		<a>
																			&#91;57&#93;
																	 and the average income for families with college students is $74,000 – 60% higher than the national average of $46,326.

																		Poverty
																<p>
																	Black transgender people live in extreme poverty with 34% reporting a household income of less than $10,000 a year, which is more than twice the rate for transgender people of all races (15%), four times the black population (9%), and eight times the U.S. population (4%).
																	<sup>

																			&#91;53&#93;
																	 Transgender people of color are more likely to be poor, be homeless, or lack a college degree.
																	<sup>
																		<a>
																			&#91;47&#93;
																	 Multiple factors pile up on each other that force many transgender people of color to be homeless; for instance, many individuals are involved in abusive relationships or live in crime-ridden neighborhoods because of the difficulty finding employment as a transgender person and/or experiencing job loss due to transphobia in the work place.
																	<sup>
																		<a>
																			&#91;54&#93;
																	 Those with greater socioeconomic status might use their social connections to advocate for access to appropriate housing for transgender students in ways that are not possible for most lower-income families; one proposal comes from the Administration for Children and Families, which issued the largest-ever LGBT focused federal grant to develop a model program to support LGBT foster youth and prevent them from being homeless.

																		<a>
																			&#91;60&#93;
																	 Transgender women face harsher levels of discrimination than other transgender people. A study on workplace experiences after people receive sex changes found that trans women, on average, lose almost one third of their salary (see 
																	<a>
																		Gender pay gap in the United States
																	), are respected less, and receive more harassment. At the same time, trans men often experience salary raises and greater authority in the workplace.
																	<sup>
																		<a>
																			&#91;61&#93;
																<p>
																	The experiences trans men face are vastly different from those of trans women; trans men who were raised as female were treated differently as soon as they came out as male. They gained professional experience, but lost intimacy; exuded authority, but caused fear.

																		Representation in media
																<p>
																	Representation in pop culture has major effects on both the 
																	<a>
																		transgender
																	 and 
																	<a>
																		cisgender
																	 communities. In addition to the above list, 
																	<a>
																		Wendy Carlos
																	, synthesizer player and recording artist, in 1979 announced that she had been living at least 11 years as a woman, and that she had undergone reassignment surgery. Elizabeth Tisdell and Patricia Thompson conducted a study on the effects of representation in the media on teachers and its effect on the way they teach in the classroom. This study found that when teachers had been exposed to programming that featured diverse characters in a positive light, teachers were more open to teaching their students in a more open, accepting way.
																	<sup>
																		<a>
																			&#91;82&#93;
																	 In this study, the authors found that media reinforces the values of the 
																	<a>
																		dominant culture
																	, and is one of the most powerful ways to informally educate people.
																	<sup>
																		<a>
																			&#91;82&#93;
																	 Tisdell and Thompson state that this representation is a way in which people construct ideas of themselves and others, and that more representation lends legitimacy to identities and movements such as the transgender movement.

																<p>
																	In a separate study, 
																	<a>
																		GLAAD
																	 looked at the representation of transgender characters in the media over the last ten years.
																	<sup>
																		<a>
																			&#91;83&#93;
																	 After examining many different episodes and storylines, GLAAD found that 
																	<a>
																		transgender characters
																	 were cast in a "victim" role in 40% of the catalogued episodes, and were cast as killers or victims in 21% of the episodes.
																	<sup>
																		<a>
																			&#91;83&#93;
																	 They also found that the most common profession of transgender characters in the episodes was 
																	<a>
																		sex workers
																	, seen in about 20% of the episodes.
																	<sup>
																		<a>
																			&#91;83&#93;
																	 In addition to the representation of transgender characters, the authors found that anti-transgender slurs, language, and dialogue were present in at least 61% of the episodes.

																		Magnus Hirschfeld
																	 was a German physician and advocate for sexual minorities. Much of his medical research was on sexuality, specifically homosexuality. He was one of the earliest to suggest that homosexuality was innate. Along with Max Spohr, Franz Josef von Bülow, and Eduard Oberg, he founded the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee in 1897, which is considered to be the first gay rights organization.
																	<sup>
																		<a>
																			&#91;89&#93;
																	 Hirschfield also established the Institute for Sexual Research, which would go on to perform the first modern vaginoplasties by 1930. Unfortunately, most of his books and research were burned by the Nazis.

																			&#91;91&#93;
																	 She sees her fame as an opportunity to bring awareness to causes that matter and that her unique position legitimizes the transgender rights movement.
																	<sup>

																			&#91;92&#93;
																	 Particularly, she believes that transgender individuals have been historically overlooked and sidelined not just socially, but in the fight for civil rights as well.
																	<sup>
																		<a>
																			&#91;93&#93;
																	 Cox acknowledges the progress that has been made for Gay rights, but that it is important to focus on transgender rights separately, seeing as it has historically been grouped together with other causes and used as an umbrella term.

																	 The news had been speculated for months leading up to the announcement, but still shocked the public and received considerable attention.

																	 Jenner's transition has been documented by the short-lived reality television series titled

																		I am Cait.
																	<sup>
																		<a>
																			&#91;99&#93;
																	 Jenner was determined to make a difference and bring awareness to transgender rights, believing that telling her story can do so. Jenner did increase transgender visibility, however, her commentary and series were criticized for misrepresenting the struggles of the majority the trans community, who are much less privileged than her and face deeper problems.
																	<sup>
																		<a>
																			&#91;100&#93;
																<p>
																	Jenner has been sharply criticized by many activists in the transgender rights movement for stating in an interview with

																	 that trans girls should not be allowed to compete in girls' sports at school, backing Republican Party views on 
																	<a>
																		transgender people in sports
																	.
																	<sup>
																		<a>
																			&#91;20&#93;
																	 Her comments lead to criticism amongst the trans and broader LGBTQ+ community; some advocates have questioned Jenner's status as a trans activist, saying that "[Jenner] did not represent the broader LGBT community".
